<h2 id="installation" >Setup / Installation</h2>
<p>In order to get the server and client application code working on your machine, <a href="https://insidesherpa.s3.amazonaws.com/vinternships/companyassets/Sj7temL583QAYpHXD/setup_devenv_m3_v3.pdf">follow the setup here</a></p>

<p><b>Note</b>:This is the version that uses Python 3.</p>

<h2>How to Run</h2>
<p>Start the data feed server by running the python server</p>
<p>Make sure your terminal / command line is in the repository first before doing any of this.</p>
<p>If you are using Windows, make sure to run your terminal/command prompt as administrator.</p>

<code>python datafeed/server3.py</code>

If you encounter an issue with `datautil.parser`, run this command:

	pip install python-dateutil

If you don't have pip, you can install it from: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/

Run <code>npm install && npm start</code> to start the React application.

It's okay to have audit warnings when installing/running the app.

If you don't have `npm` (although you should if you followed the set up / installation part), you can install the recommended version alongside NodeJS from: https://nodejs.org/en/

The recommended version are node v11.0.0 and npm v6.4.1

Open http://localhost:3000 to view the app in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.

<h2>Known Issues</h2>
Some users seem to be having trouble with the unzipped version of the node_modules back up for windows.
